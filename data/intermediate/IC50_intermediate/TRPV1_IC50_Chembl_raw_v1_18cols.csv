Cells were passaged frequently, every 3-5 days, to avoid overgrowth, depletion of essential medium components, or acidic medium exposure. Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT). The cells were incubated in 100 ÃÂ¼L/well Fluo-3/AM (2 ÃÂ¼M; TEFLabs #0116) with Pluronic F127 (100 ÃÂ¼g/mL; Sigma #P2443) for 1 h at rt in the dark. After loading the cells, the dye solution was replaced with 50 ÃÂ¼L/well of 20 ÃÂ¼M calcium assay buffer using the ELx405 plate washer. Test compounds (50 ÃÂ¼L/well) were added to the plate and incubated for 30 min. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were subsequently assayed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPRÃ¢ÂÂ¢ instrument, Molecular Devices, CA) to simultaneously monitor Fluo-3 fluorescence in all wells (ÃÂ»excitation=488 nm, ÃÂ»emission=540 nm) during challenge with agonist (capsaicin). The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration. The magnitude of the capsaicin response was determined by measuring the change in fluo3 fluorescence before and 100 seconds after the addition of the agonist.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,HEK293,CHEMBL3886208,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3307715

The cells were incubated in 100 ÃÂ¼L/well Fluo-3/AM (2 ÃÂ¼M; TEFLabs #0116) with Pluronic F127 (100 ÃÂ¼g/mL; Sigma #P2443) for 1 h at rt in the dark. After loading the cells, the dye solution was replaced with 50 ÃÂ¼L/well of 20 ÃÂ¼M calcium assay buffer using the ELx405 plate washer. Test compounds (50 ÃÂ¼L/well) were added to the plate and incubated for 30 min. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were subsequently assayed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPRÃ¢ÂÂ¢ instrument, Molecular Devices, CA) to simultaneously monitor Fluo-3 fluorescence in all wells (ÃÂ»excitation=488 nm, ÃÂ»emission=540 nm) during challenge with agonist (capsaicin). The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration. The magnitude of the capsaicin response was determined by measuring the change in fluo3 fluorescence before and 100 seconds after the addition of the agonist.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,HEK293,CHEMBL3886208,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3307715

Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency.

Then, the cells were loaded with 5 uM Fluo-4, a Ca2+ reporter dye, in the presence of 2.5 mM probenecid at 37ÃÂ° C. with 5% CO2, for 45 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with measuring buffer (assay buffer supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 3.2 mM CaCl2) then transferred to a Fast 96-well Reaction Plate (0.1 mL) (Part no. 4346907, MICROAMP, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). The cell density was 100,000 cells/24 uL/well. A solution of the compound under test (6 uL/well) was added into each well of the 96-well plate. Thus, the reaction volume per well was 30 uL. The plates were then placed inside an ABI7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) to read fluorescence at different temperatures using 7500 software, version 2.0.2 (Applied Biosystems).

In particular, Ca2+ influx into TRPV1/CHO cells in response to low pH as measured by Fura-2 AM fluorescence was determined. The cells were stimulated using 3.0 mM (well numbers B1-B6), 3.1 mM (C1-C6), 3.2 mM (D1-D6), 3.3 mM (E1-E6), 3.4 mM (F1-F6), 3.5 mM (G1-G6), or 3.6 mM (H1-H6) H2SO4 or pH 7.2 measuring buffer without H2SO4 (A1-A6). Culture medium was removed using an 8-channel-pipette (Rainin, USA) from the 96-well plate and the wells were refilled with 100 uL of loading buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 5 uM Fura-2 AM (Dojin, Japan). The 96-well plate was incubated at 37ÃÂ° C. for 45 min. The loading buffer was removed from each well. The cells were subsequently washed twice with 150 uL of measuring buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) (no probenecid). The wells were then refilled with 80 uL of measuring buffer. After an incubation at 4ÃÂ° C. for 15 min, the 96-well plate was transferred to a model FDSS-3000 plate reader apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan). The Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm and at 380 nm, respectively, at a rate of 0.5 Hz for a total of 240 seconds. After 16 time points (32 sec) of baseline detection, 20 uL of agonist solution was added to each well. The final volume was 100 uL/well. Fluorescence intensity ratio refers to the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm at a particular time point. The baseline was set as the average of the fluorescent intensity ratios for the first 16 time points before the addition of agonist solution. The maximum response was the highest fluorescent intensity ratio during the 60 time points following addition of agonist solution.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,CHO,CHEMBL3886186,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3308072

Cells were passaged frequently, every 3-5 days, to avoid overgrowth, depletion of essential medium components, or acidic medium exposure. Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT).

The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound.

In particular, Ca2+ influx into TRPV1/CHO cells in response to low pH as measured by Fura-2 AM fluorescence was determined. The cells were stimulated using 3.0 mM (well numbers B1-B6), 3.1 mM (C1-C6), 3.2 mM (D1-D6), 3.3 mM (E1-E6), 3.4 mM (F1-F6), 3.5 mM (G1-G6), or 3.6 mM (H1-H6) H2SO4 or pH 7.2 measuring buffer without H2SO4 (A1-A6). Culture medium was removed using an 8-channel-pipette (Rainin, USA) from the 96-well plate and the wells were refilled with 100 uL of loading buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 5 uM Fura-2 AM (Dojin, Japan). The 96-well plate was incubated at 37ÃÂ° C. for 45 min. The loading buffer was removed from each well. The cells were subsequently washed twice with 150 uL of measuring buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) (no probenecid). The wells were then refilled with 80 uL of measuring buffer. After an incubation at 4ÃÂ° C. for 15 min, the 96-well plate was transferred to a model FDSS-3000 plate reader apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan). The Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm and at 380 nm, respectively, at a rate of 0.5 Hz for a total of 240 seconds. After 16 time points (32 sec) of baseline detection, 20 uL of agonist solution was added to each well. The final volume was 100 uL/well. Fluorescence intensity ratio refers to the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm at a particular time point. The baseline was set as the average of the fluorescent intensity ratios for the first 16 time points before the addition of agonist solution. The maximum response was the highest fluorescent intensity ratio during the 60 time points following addition of agonist solution.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,CHO,CHEMBL3886186,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3308072

Cells were passaged frequently, every 3-5 days, to avoid overgrowth, depletion of essential medium components, or acidic medium exposure. Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency.

Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2.

Functional assessment of heat-induced activation of hTRPV1 was carried out in a cell-based Ca2+ flux assay using ABI7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System as described in Reubish et al., 'Functional assessment of temperature-gated ion-channel activity using a real-time PCR machine,' www.BioTechniques.com 47(3):iii-ix (2009), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, hTRPV1/CHO cells were cultured in growth media in a tissue culture dish at 37ÃÂ° C. in a CO2 incubator. On the day of the assay, culture media were removed and the cells were then detached using 0.05% trypsin at 37ÃÂ° C. with 5% CO2, for 90 s.

The cells were subsequently washed twice with 150 uL of measuring buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) (no probenecid). The wells were then refilled with 80 uL of measuring buffer. After an incubation at 4ÃÂ° C. for 15 min, the 96-well plate was transferred to a model FDSS-3000 plate reader apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan). The Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm and at 380 nm, respectively, at a rate of 0.5 Hz for a total of 240 seconds. After 16 time points (32 sec) of baseline detection, 20 uL of agonist solution was added to each well. The final volume was 100 uL/well. Fluorescence intensity ratio refers to the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm at a particular time point. The baseline was set as the average of the fluorescent intensity ratios for the first 16 time points before the addition of agonist solution. The maximum response was the highest fluorescent intensity ratio during the 60 time points following addition of agonist solution.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,CHO,CHEMBL3886186,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3308072

Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT).

The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration.

The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration. The magnitude of the capsaicin response was determined by measuring the change in fluo3 fluorescence before and 100 seconds after the addition of the agonist.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,HEK293,CHEMBL3886208,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3307715

Cells were passaged frequently, every 3-5 days, to avoid overgrowth, depletion of essential medium components, or acidic medium exposure. Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT).

On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT). The cells were incubated in 100 ÃÂ¼L/well Fluo-3/AM (2 ÃÂ¼M; TEFLabs #0116) with Pluronic F127 (100 ÃÂ¼g/mL; Sigma #P2443) for 1 h at rt in the dark. After loading the cells, the dye solution was replaced with 50 ÃÂ¼L/well of 20 ÃÂ¼M calcium assay buffer using the ELx405 plate washer. Test compounds (50 ÃÂ¼L/well) were added to the plate and incubated for 30 min. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were subsequently assayed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPRÃ¢ÂÂ¢ instrument, Molecular Devices, CA) to simultaneously monitor Fluo-3 fluorescence in all wells (ÃÂ»excitation=488 nm, ÃÂ»emission=540 nm) during challenge with agonist (capsaicin). The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration.

In particular, Ca2+ influx into TRPV1/CHO cells in response to low pH as measured by Fura-2 AM fluorescence was determined. The cells were stimulated using 3.0 mM (well numbers B1-B6), 3.1 mM (C1-C6), 3.2 mM (D1-D6), 3.3 mM (E1-E6), 3.4 mM (F1-F6), 3.5 mM (G1-G6), or 3.6 mM (H1-H6) H2SO4 or pH 7.2 measuring buffer without H2SO4 (A1-A6). Culture medium was removed using an 8-channel-pipette (Rainin, USA) from the 96-well plate and the wells were refilled with 100 uL of loading buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 5 uM Fura-2 AM (Dojin, Japan). The 96-well plate was incubated at 37ÃÂ° C. for 45 min. The loading buffer was removed from each well. The cells were subsequently washed twice with 150 uL of measuring buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) (no probenecid).

After an incubation at 4ÃÂ° C. for 15 min, the 96-well plate was transferred to a model FDSS-3000 plate reader apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan). The Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm and at 380 nm, respectively, at a rate of 0.5 Hz for a total of 240 seconds. After 16 time points (32 sec) of baseline detection, 20 uL of agonist solution was added to each well. The final volume was 100 uL/well. Fluorescence intensity ratio refers to the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm at a particular time point. The baseline was set as the average of the fluorescent intensity ratios for the first 16 time points before the addition of agonist solution.

Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency.

The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration.

The cells were stimulated using 3.0 mM (well numbers B1-B6), 3.1 mM (C1-C6), 3.2 mM (D1-D6), 3.3 mM (E1-E6), 3.4 mM (F1-F6), 3.5 mM (G1-G6), or 3.6 mM (H1-H6) H2SO4 or pH 7.2 measuring buffer without H2SO4 (A1-A6). Culture medium was removed using an 8-channel-pipette (Rainin, USA) from the 96-well plate and the wells were refilled with 100 uL of loading buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 5 uM Fura-2 AM (Dojin, Japan). The 96-well plate was incubated at 37ÃÂ° C. for 45 min. The loading buffer was removed from each well. The cells were subsequently washed twice with 150 uL of measuring buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) (no probenecid). The wells were then refilled with 80 uL of measuring buffer. After an incubation at 4ÃÂ° C. for 15 min, the 96-well plate was transferred to a model FDSS-3000 plate reader apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan). The Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm and at 380 nm, respectively, at a rate of 0.5 Hz for a total of 240 seconds. After 16 time points (32 sec) of baseline detection, 20 uL of agonist solution was added to each well. The final volume was 100 uL/well. Fluorescence intensity ratio refers to the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm at a particular time point. The baseline was set as the average of the fluorescent intensity ratios for the first 16 time points before the addition of agonist solution. The maximum response was the highest fluorescent intensity ratio during the 60 time points following addition of agonist solution.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,CHO,CHEMBL3886186,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3308072

The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT).

The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration.

Cells were passaged frequently, every 3-5 days, to avoid overgrowth, depletion of essential medium components, or acidic medium exposure. Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT).

The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration.

Cells were passaged using a brief wash in 0.05% trypsin with 1 mM EDTA, followed by dissociation in divalent-free phosphate-buffered saline (Hyclone #SH30028.02). Dissociated cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated black-walled 96-well plates (Biocoat; Becton Dickinson #354640) at about 40,000 cells per well and grown for approximately 1 day in culture medium to near confluency. The assay buffer was composed of 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and either 2 mM or 20 ÃÂ¼M CaCl2. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with 2 mM calcium assay buffer using an automated plate washer (ELx405; Biotek, VT). The cells were incubated in 100 ÃÂ¼L/well Fluo-3/AM (2 ÃÂ¼M; TEFLabs #0116) with Pluronic F127 (100 ÃÂ¼g/mL; Sigma #P2443) for 1 h at rt in the dark. After loading the cells, the dye solution was replaced with 50 ÃÂ¼L/well of 20 ÃÂ¼M calcium assay buffer using the ELx405 plate washer. Test compounds (50 ÃÂ¼L/well) were added to the plate and incubated for 30 min. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were subsequently assayed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPRÃ¢ÂÂ¢ instrument, Molecular Devices, CA) to simultaneously monitor Fluo-3 fluorescence in all wells (ÃÂ»excitation=488 nm, ÃÂ»emission=540 nm) during challenge with agonist (capsaicin). The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration. The magnitude of the capsaicin response was determined by measuring the change in fluo3 fluorescence before and 100 seconds after the addition of the agonist.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,HEK293,CHEMBL3886208,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3307715

In particular, Ca2+ influx into TRPV1/CHO cells in response to low pH as measured by Fura-2 AM fluorescence was determined. The cells were stimulated using 3.0 mM (well numbers B1-B6), 3.1 mM (C1-C6), 3.2 mM (D1-D6), 3.3 mM (E1-E6), 3.4 mM (F1-F6), 3.5 mM (G1-G6), or 3.6 mM (H1-H6) H2SO4 or pH 7.2 measuring buffer without H2SO4 (A1-A6). Culture medium was removed using an 8-channel-pipette (Rainin, USA) from the 96-well plate and the wells were refilled with 100 uL of loading buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 5 uM Fura-2 AM (Dojin, Japan).

After an incubation at 4ÃÂ° C. for 15 min, the 96-well plate was transferred to a model FDSS-3000 plate reader apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan). The Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm and at 380 nm, respectively, at a rate of 0.5 Hz for a total of 240 seconds. After 16 time points (32 sec) of baseline detection, 20 uL of agonist solution was added to each well. The final volume was 100 uL/well. Fluorescence intensity ratio refers to the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm at a particular time point. The baseline was set as the average of the fluorescent intensity ratios for the first 16 time points before the addition of agonist solution. The maximum response was the highest fluorescent intensity ratio during the 60 time points following addition of agonist solution.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,CHO,CHEMBL3886186,37,BindingDB Patent Bioactivity Data,,2016,CHEMBL3308072

The IC50 values were determined. Cells were challenged with 150 nM capsaicin and the fluorescence counts were captured following agonist addition at a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz. The contents of the wells were mixed 3 times (40 ÃÂ¼L mix volume) immediately after the additions were made. Concentration dependence of block was determined by exposing each well of cells in duplicate rows of a 96 well plate to a serial dilution of test compound. The concentration series usually started at 10 ÃÂÃÂ¼M with a three-fold serial decrement in concentration.
